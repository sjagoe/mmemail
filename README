= MM-Email

Simple Clojure library for sending email.

== Installation



== Usage: The Easy Way

<code>mmemail.core</code> is the only include you need.  It contains only 2 methods, the fist being <code>send-email</code>.
It takes a map that includes all the configuration and email parameters.  That's it.

    (use `mmemail.core)
    (send-email {:host "smtp.gmail.com" :port 465 :ssl true :user "road@gmail.com" :password "runner" :to "joe@acme.com" :subject "Greetings" :text "Meep Meep!"})

Most of the parameters are required, but based on your server configuration you might get away without these:
* :ssl
* :password
* :subject

It also accepts the following optional parameters:
* :from (defaults to :user)
* :cc
* :bcc

The recipient parameters (:to, :cc, :bcc) may be a string, for one recipient, or a sequence of strings, for multiple recipients.

== Usage: The Convenient Way

It can be annoying to pass such a big map into the function, and typically you'll want to get all the server configuration
out of the way.  This is where the second function of <code>mmemail.core</code> (<code>create-mailer</code>) comes into play.

    (use `mmemail.core)
    (def my_mailer (create-mailer {:host "smtp.gmail.com" :port 465 :ssl true :user "road@gmail.com" :password "runner"}))

<code>create-mailer</code> will return a new function with all the configuration baked in. So in the future, you can send email
like so:

     (my_mailer {:to "joe@acme.com" :subject "Greetings" :text "Meep Meep!"})

The <code>create-mailer</code> accepts email parameters that will be used as defaults when the generated function is called.

    (def my_mailer (create-mailer {:subject "Greetings" :text "Meep Meep!" :host "smtp.gmail.com" :port 465 :ssl true :user "road@gmail.com" :password "runner"}))
    (my_mailer {:to "joe@acme.com"})
